# Introduction

A simple implementation using React hooks to manage Form states. All the components are stateless whereas global state is managed by ngSubmit.

I will add unit tests and push this to the npm.

Feel free to fork or change this!

## How to run this.

Simple

- Clone the repo
- npm i
- npm start

This is using React-scripts!
